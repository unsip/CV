{\noindent
    Software and operations engineer with a several years of SRE expertise. I possess extensive experience across entire
    production lifecycle and understand wide range of issues regarding backend/frontend development, high-load
    infrastructure, QA, operations, incident management and customer perspectives. My experience in an international
    environment combined with fluent English enables me to get along with foreign co-workers and customers quickly.
    Self-education is of the highest value for me, which I am always striving for. I appreciate scientific endeavors and
    enjoy exploring world of abstract ideas. I aim to further develop my skills in software engineering, architecture
    design, DevOps practices and distributed systems. My primary career goal is to acquire expertise in technologically advanced domains
    with a focus on reliability and social impact such as finance, healthcare, telecommunications, automotive,
    education, hardware, OS development and Research \& Development (R\&D) departments.
