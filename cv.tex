{\noindent I am novice in software development and interested in acquiring
expertise in OOP, functional programming, linux hosts administration and
maintainance, DevOps, scripting and automation of daily tasks. Usually, I spend
most of my spare time on self-education through Computer Science courses (such
as OSS), reading documentation and various manual pages to increase my
understanding of the system. The most important job-aspect for me is to learn
new things, as well as getting proficiency in solving challenging problems. I
can easily read and understand technical English literature, just as
understanding spoken language, so there is no problem for me to overtake
job-specific material, which I am ready to dive in.
