{\noindent I'm proficient software configuration manager and novice developer.
    Self-education is of the highest value for me, which I'm always striving
    for.  Open Source Society University courses, daily usage of Linux OS (for
    more than 6 years) and working on pet projects helped me to get into
    industry, so I'm looking forward to sharpen my skills in DevOps practices
    and software engineering.  The most important job-aspect for me is to
    acquire expertise in solving challenging problems using modern technologies
    and practices. I have read a lot of academic English literature and had an
    experience working for international company, it won't be an issue for me
    to get along with foreign co-workers and customers. In my spare time I
    enjoy studying humanities, learning programming, playing board games and
    contemplating on aesthetically pleasing art.
