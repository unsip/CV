{\noindent I'm an operations engineer with a few years of software development expertise.
    Self-education is of the highest value for me, which I'm always striving.
    Not only because regular studies got me into the industry, but also because
    I appreciate scientific endeavour and enjoy exploring world of abstract
    ideas. Hence, I'm looking forward to further improve my skills in software
    architecture, infrastructure design and DevOps practices.
    \newline
    \newline
    The essential job-aspect for me is to
    acquire expertise in solving challenging problems using modern technologies
    and cutting edge approaches. My experience in an international environment
    enables me to get along with foreign co-workers and customers quickly.
    In my spare time, I enjoy studying humanities, maintaining
    \href{https://exherbo.org/}{Exherbo Linux} distribution,
    playing board games, and contemplating on aesthetically pleasing art.
