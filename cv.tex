{\noindent I'm proficient software configuration manager and novice developer.
    My wide interests lie between designing of complex infrastucture using best
    DevOps practices, acquiring expertise in solving complex programming
    problems by applying such paradigms and principles as OOP, SOLID,
    functional programming, up to grasping on sophisticated philosophical
    concepts and trying myself in audio-visual arts. I have spent a lot of time
    on self-education through Computer Science courses (such as Open Source
    Society University), daily usage of *nix systems and working on pet
    projects, so I'm always passionate about learning new things and diving
    into complex problems. I have read a lot of academic English literature and
    had an experience working for international company, it won't be an issue
    for me to get along with foreign co-workers and customers. In my spare time
    I enjoy to read on humanities, learn programming, playing board games and
    contemplate on aesthetically pleasing art.
